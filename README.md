Unity Version : 2020.3.18f1;

System Setup;
the main classes would be the SlotMachineMain.cs, SlotMachineReel.cs and SymbolDetector.cs.;
the game has three buttons, the knob that starts and stops the roll, and the plus and minus that adjust the bet.;
theres not alot of prefabs on my project just the five different reels.;
